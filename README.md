The Wastewater Infrastructure Map is a collaborative effort led by the Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO) at the University of Vermont, supported by the Windham Regional Commission, Vermont state agencies, and funded by the Leahy Institute. The goal was to map and analyze wastewater infrastructure across every town in Vermont. Developed with 15 undergraduate interns (through UVM’s Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA) student intership program from Fall 2024 to June 2025, this project delivers comprehensive geospatial datasets aimed at informing regional planning, economic development, and housing growth

## Objectives
* Thoroughly map sewer systems (pipes, manholes, outflows), treatment facilities, service areas, and onsite soil suitability.
* Fill in missing infrastructure data gaps left by existing Vermont GIS resources,
* Produce user-friendly, public-domain datasets that support infrastructure planning and align with broader Vermont Climate, Energy, and Transportation plans .

## Project Timeline & Scope
Initiated: Fall 2024 under Chris Campany (Windham Regional Commission), funded by UVM’s Leahy Institute 

### Milestones:
* Exploratory research & cataloging — Nov 2024
* Outreach to local system managers — Feb 2025
* Data architecture development — Feb 2025
* Statewide dataset completion — June 2025

## Map Layers

This project consists of 5 layers to paint a picture of wastewater infrastructure in Vermont towns:
- **Wastewater Linear Features**: Includes pipes from wastewater and combined systems
- **Wastewater Point Features**: Includes manholes and some catchbasin locations
- **Sewer Service Area**: Service area for wastewater treatment plants
- **Wastewater Treatment Facilities**: Includes all municipal, industrial, and pretreatment wastewater treatment facilities and their hydraulic capacity information
- **Onsite Sewage Disposal Soil Ratings**: Depicts onsite sewage disposal classification of Vermont soils

## Data Sources

Most data used is from the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (see [Existing GIS Data](https://github.com/VERSO-UVM/Wastewater-Infrastructure-Mapping/blob/main/ExistingGISData.md)). Some new data has been digitized from town plans or documents provided by municipalities. The Onsite Sewage Disposal Soil Ratings map was prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.

## Funding

This project was made possible with a grant from the [Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships](https://www.uvm.edu/ruralpartnerships).
