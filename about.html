            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>The Wastewater Infrastructure Map was initiated by [Chris Campany](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-campany-846751a), Executive Director of the [Windham Regional Commission](http://www.windhamregional.org/) and funded by the [Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships](https://www.uvm.edu/ruralpartnerships) at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu) in the fall of 2024. The goal was to create a comprehensive map of wastewater systems including sewer lines, treatment facilities, service areas and service points. A wastewater system, also known as a sewage or sewer system, refers to the infrastructure designed to collect, transport, treat, and dispose of wastewater generated from residential, commercial, and industrial sources. The system typically includes a network of pipes, pumps, lift stations, and treatment facilities that work together to manage and process wastewater before releasing it back into the environment.
            </p>
            <p>At the time of the project the State of [Vermont Agency of Natural Resources](https://anr.vermont.gov/) had a partial map in their [Natural Resources Atlas](https://anrmaps.vermont.gov/websites/anra5/), but there were known gaps. Mr. Campany hoped to both demonstrate what is not known about wastewater systems either because the information is still not digitized or simply does not exist, and providing a tool for regional planning commissions and policy makings to understand where systems need creation, expansion or replacement to support housing in Vermont. 
            </p>
            <p>In order to complete this project, the [Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/) at the University of Vermont brought together a group of students in paid internships through the [Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) program to bring together current maps and digital assets, conduct extensive outreach to towns and treatment systems and map the entire state in a constant manner.
            </p>
            Over the Fall 2024-Summer 2025 period 15 undergraduate students worked together in over 2,000 hours of work to create geospatial datasets and enter them into this GitHub repo, with the goal that the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources would take the completed file and update their atlas. The data creation was completed in June 2025, followed by quality checks of the data to confirm validity as much as possible.

            <p>This project consists of 5 layers to paint a picture of wastewater infrastructure in Vermont towns:
            <ul>
                <li>Wastewater Linear Features: Includes pipes from wastewater and combined systems</li>
                <li>Wastewater Point Features: Includes manholes and some catchbasin locations</li>
                <li>Sewer Service Area: Service area for wastewater treatment plants</li>
                <li>Wastewater Treatment Facilities: Includes all municipal, industrial, and pretreatment wastewater treatment facilities and their hydraulic capacity information</li>
                <li>Onsite Sewage Disposal Soil Ratings: Depicts onsite sewage disposal classification of Vermont soils</li>
            </ul>
