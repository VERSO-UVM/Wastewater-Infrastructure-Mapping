            <p>The Wastewater Infrastructure Map was the collective effort in 2024-2025 of University of Vermont student interns in the Open Research Community Accelerator program. The goal was to create a state-wide map for Vermont of wastewater sewage lines, treatment facilities, service areas and access points. Funded by the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships in partnership with the Widnham Regional Commsions, the students combined current data from multiple sources to make the map below.

         This map attempts to address critical challenges in Vermont's development landscape by conducting a comprehensive assessment of wastewater infrastructure across towns in the state. A wastewater system, also known as a sewage or sewer system, refers to the infrastructure designed to collect, transport, treat, and dispose of wastewater generated from residential, commercial, and industrial sources. The system typically includes a network of pipes, pumps, lift stations, and treatment facilities that work together to manage and process wastewater before releasing it back into the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        This initiative, in collaboration with the Windham Regional Commission, the State of Vermont Agency of Natural Resources and the Department of Environmental Conservation, we attempt to systematically map wastewater infrastructure data to understand its impact on economic activity and housing development. This includes finding what data is already available, working with partners to determine the format of the data to be collected, and then working with available online resources and reaching out to towns to identify and record wastewater systems.
